# Chess Engine in C

This is a simple chess engine written in C. It was built as a fun project to learn the C programming language. While it is very basic and far from being the strongest or most optimized engine, it helped me understand the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, and chess logic. I don’t plan to actively update it unless I get bored during school breaks, but I’ve achieved my primary goal of learning C through this project.

## Limitations

- **Double pawn moves** are allowed past the first rank, which is illegal in chess.
- **No castling** or **en passant** rules implemented.
- The engine doesn’t prevent **illegal moves** (e.g., moving the King into check).
- The engine currently only looks **one move ahead**, making it quite weak and easy to beat.
- The engine can only play as **black**, so there’s no white player side logic.

## Future Plans

- I don’t have plans to update this chess engine actively.
- While it can certainly be optimized and improved, I’d rather focus on learning new programming languages, building new projects, and focusing on school at the moment.
  
## Why This Project?

This was my first significant project, and it was an incredibly fun learning experience. I didn’t focus on creating the strongest or most efficient engine. Instead, my goal was to understand the basics of chess logic, move generation, and the C programming language.

## Final Thoughts

I’ve achieved what I set out to do — learn the core concepts behind a chess engine. The project is "finished" in that sense, but it's also "unfinished" because I know there’s so much more I could improve, like adding a better AI, optimizing performance, and handling all chess rules. However, I’m happy with the progress I’ve made and I’m moving on to other projects and learning opportunities.

If you want to dive in, improve the engine, or just have fun experimenting with it, feel free to fork this repository!
